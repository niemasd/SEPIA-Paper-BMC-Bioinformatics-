% if your bibliography is in bibtex format, use those commands:
\bibliographystyle{bmc-mathphys} % Style BST file (bmc-mathphys, vancouver, spbasic).
\bibliography{bmc_article}      % Bibliography file (usually '*.bib' )
% for author-year bibliography (bmc-mathphys or spbasic)
% a) write to bib file (bmc-mathphys only)
% @settings{label, options="nameyear"}
% b) uncomment next line
%\nocite{label}

% or include bibliography directly:
\begin{thebibliography}
